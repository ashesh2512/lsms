	Abstract = {Abstract The Locally Self-consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS) code solves the first principles Density Functional theory Kohn--Sham equation for a wide range of materials with a special focus on metals, alloys and metallic nano-structures. It has traditionally exhibited near perfect scalability on massively parallel high performance computer architectures. We present our efforts to exploit \{GPUs\} to accelerate the \{LSMS\} code to enable first principles calculations of O(100,000) atoms and statistical physics sampling of finite temperature properties. We reimplement the scattering matrix calculation for \{GPUs\} with a block matrix inversion algorithm that only uses accelerator memory. Using the Cray \{XK7\} system Titan at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility we achieve a sustained performance of 14.5PFlop/s and a speedup of 8.6 compared to the \{CPU\} only code. },
