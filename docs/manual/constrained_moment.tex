LSMS supports multiple modes to constrain the magnetic
moments:

\begin{enumarate}
\item Fixed Moment Direction. This is the original mode supported since LSMS version 1.
      The direction of the moment is fixed and the magnitude of the moment is found selfconsistently.
\item Fixed Constraining Field. The local field is specified and the resulting
      moment might point into any direction and magnitude.
\item Fixed Moment. Selfconsistently fiend the constraining field to obtain the specified
      moment direction and magnitude.
\end{enumerate}
